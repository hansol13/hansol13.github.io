dear RCF,

First of all, thank you guys for all of the work you guys put into senior night.

I'd love to go on about how much I love and care for you guys, but I've never
really been good at showing affection in that way. I tend to show that I care
through action and I hope that by serving you guys for Christ showed how much
I love all of you. Honestly, I just want the best for everyone here and I am
confident that such will only be obtained by having our community be rooted in
Christ year after year so that we can really work at the mission God entrusted
with us. We can do this by being there for each other every day, spending time
with each other, and sacrificing for one another, the way Christ did for His
disciples. Yes, Christ's teachings came through His sermons, but more importantly,
He showed us that spending time with the people around us is the only way to
grow to God together. Simply praying for one another on your own or simply attending
Sunday service/Cg/Large group is not what it takes. Engage with one another, the
way Christ engages with us, and the world will see why RCF is so damn special.

Something I really felt compelled to address is something a little heavier.
I think at this point, we all know mental illness is no joke, and can really mess
with our brothers and sisters. Especially in a culture where we're taught to bring
our best to God only. God doesn't want our best, He wants our all. God wants you
when you're depressed, stressed, anxious, panicked, and also when you're filled with
joy. However, it's no joke when we say mental illness messes people up.
Mental illnesses really have the ability to convince people that they are the only
ones who are not worth Christ's love. This is something I wouldn't wish on my worst
enemy and it breaks my heart to know that I and some of us here tonight have been
hit by this form of attack to varying degrees.
And in my experience, the only thing we as a community can do for each other in
these situations, is spend thoughtful time with one another. Not only asking for
other people's struggles, but sharing your own. If you were ever in my CG, you know
I believe that no one is going to open up to you unless you make it known you can
be trusted, and I believe this is done by opening up to those around you first.
This is something the upperclassmen before us taught me. And honestly, if they
never cared to ask about how I was doing, I'd never understand what makes RCF
so precious. And honestly, I'd probably still think of myself as the smallest
person in the world, thinking that I'm stupider, slower, and weaker spiritually
than everyone else. You guys and my upperclassmen showed me that our confidence
is only real when we acknowledge that we all suck because of our sinful nature,
and that makes the grace of God so much sweeter.

And so, share your struggles, share what makes you hurt, share what brings you peace and joy.
Share what you love about God and what you might even dislike about God.
Talk with each other, because we're all sinful and dumb, but God is that much
greater. I think we've all experienced what it's like to be alone at night
and overthink and we all know how much that sucks.

4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by
grace you have been saved.

Serve each other - buy each other food, ice cream, give each other little things,
get an extra muffin to give to the first person you see.

I'd love more than anything to stay around here and continue to serve this community.
I have no idea where God whether God is keeping me here or sending me somewhere else
so I can actually grow up and be an adult instead of remaining around college forever(lol).
As my last words to you guys as a fellow undergrad, I'd like to share with you guys
my favorite verse:
"I appeal to you therefore, brothers,[a] by the mercies of God, to present your
bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual
 worship"" -esv

"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy,
to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—
this is your spiritual act of worship" -niv86
